## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a learning journal, documenting Java programming concepts through hands-on examples. Each exercise folder (ex_001, ex_002, etc.) will focus on different aspects of software development.

## 🚀 Future Exercises

More exercise folders will be added covering:
- Advanced design patterns
- Multithreading and concurrency
- File I/O and serialization
- Database connectivity (JDBC)
- Testing and debugging
- And much more...

## 📖 How to Use

1. Navigate to any exercise folder
2. Read the specific README for that exercise
