| **P005 - Expense Tracker** | User Authentication, Collections, Data Persistence | ✅ Complete |

### 07 - Advanced Concepts
**Concepts Covered:**
- Advanced Polymorphism
- Design Patterns
- Complex Data Structures
- Production-Ready Code Patterns

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### Learn by Building
Every concept is learned through hands-on implementation. Theory is reinforced by writing working code that solves real problems.

### Error Handling First
From day one, code includes proper input validation, exception handling, and edge case management. This builds production-ready habits early.

### Production Mindset
Code is written with:
- Clear naming conventions
- Proper encapsulation
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Modular design
